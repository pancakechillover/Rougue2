# Project Tracker & Agent Instructions

## Role & Workflow
You are an AI assistant maintaining the "Scholar's Dungeon" project. 
At the start of every interaction, you automatically read this file (injected into your system prompt).

**CRITICAL RULE FOR EVERY UPDATE:**
We now separate updates into **Preview Updates** (预览更新) and **Official Updates** (正式更新):

**1. Preview Updates (预览更新 - Default):**
- Update the `APP_VERSION` in `src/version.ts`.
- Update the `Current Version` and `Last Update Date` in this `AGENTS.md` file.
- Log the completed task in the `Task History` section below.
- *Do not* modify `RELEASE_HISTORY` in `src/version.ts` or `public/version.json`.

**2. Official Updates (正式更新 - Only when requested):**
- Do all the steps for Preview Updates.
- Aggregate all features/fixes logged in `AGENTS.md` since the last Official Update.
- Write a comprehensive changelog summarizing these updates.
- Update `RELEASE_HISTORY` in `src/version.ts` with this aggregated changelog.
- Update `public/version.json` with the new version and changelog to trigger the app update popup.

**VERSIONING POLICY (x.y.z):**
- **x (Major):** Critical architectural changes or full-scale system overhauls.
- **y (Minor):** New features, significant UI additions, or functional enhancements.
- **z (Patch):** Bug fixes, micro-optimizations, documentation updates, and UI refinements.

**COMMUNICATION RULE:**
- You MUST ALWAYS reply to the user in Chinese (Simplified). This is an absolute requirement for every response you give.

**CSS & UI STANDARDS:**
- **Strict English UI Standard:** All UI elements across the application (labels, titles, headings, buttons, badges, tabs, tooltips, placeholders, modal dialogs, and settings descriptions) MUST strictly and exclusively be in English. NEVER use Chinese characters or bilingual slash labels (such as `English / 中文`) in the application interface or code. (Note: The assistant still replies to the user in Chinese (Simplified) during chat interactions, but the app UI itself is 100% pure English).
- **Full-Screen Modals:** Whenever creating a "full-screen" centered modal (especially `fixed inset-0`), you MUST use `createPortal(..., document.body)` from `react-dom` to render the modal directly on the `body`. If you do not use `createPortal`, parent elements with CSS `transform`, `filter`, or `perspective` will establish unintended containing blocks that capture the `fixed` positioning, causing the modal to appear in the middle of a scrolling page container instead of the actual screen view. Never make this mistake again.
- **Italic Clipping:** To prevent right-side clipping of italic text (especially in browsers with tight bounding boxes), always add a small right padding (e.g., `pr-1` or `px-0.5`) to the element or its immediate container.
- **Red Dot / Notification Placement:** Unread message or notification badges (red dots) on icons and buttons MUST ALWAYS be placed in the bottom-right corner (e.g. `absolute -bottom-0.5 -right-0.5`), NEVER in the top-right corner.
- **Touch-Friendly Controls:** Delete buttons or other critical actions MUST NOT be hover-only (e.g. `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`), as this is unfriendly to touch-screen users. They should be visible or adapt properly for mobile devices.
- **Theme-Aware Colors & Minimalist UI:** We have 6 different theme colors. Every color choice (especially backgrounds, progress bars, or buttons) MUST consider all themes to maintain a minimalist and premium aesthetic. Avoid thick, flashy, or hardcoded colors like `bg-emerald-500` which may look jarring or "rough" (粗率) in certain themes. Rely on theme-aware colors (`indigo-300`, `indigo-400`, `indigo-500`, `indigo-600`) or neutral slate colors with opacity. DO NOT use `indigo-200` or `indigo-700`+ for primary themed elements, as they will appear in the default blue color across all themes.

## Current Status
- **Current Version:** v9.1.23
- **Last Update Date:** 2026-09-04
- **Last Update Time:** 07:22:00

## Dark Themes Definition
The following themes are considered "Dark Themes" and form the baseline for vibrant visual effects and high-contrast glowing elements:
- **Night** (`data-theme="night"`)
- **Forest** (`data-theme="forest"`)
- **Ocean** (`data-theme="ocean"`)

## Light Themes Definition
The following themes are considered "Light Themes" and require special CSS handling (e.g., avoiding white text on light backgrounds, using theme-aware colors for modals and charts):
- **Daylight** (`data-theme="daylight"`)
- **Warm Sun** (`state.theme === "warm"`)
- **Candy** (`state.theme === "candy"`)

## Push Notification Troubleshooting Protocols
Due to inconsistencies in Web Push delivery in various environments (Iframes, PWAs), follow this hierarchy:
1. **Execution Context:** Web Push is often blocked in cross-origin IFRAMES. Always test by opening the app in a **New Tab** or as an **Installed PWA**.
2. **Direct Permission Check:** Verify address bar shows "Allowed". 
3. **Service Worker Console:** Switch to `Application -> Service Workers -> Inspect` in DevTools to see SW-specific logs (`[Service Worker]`). Main console may skip these.
4. **OS Level:** Check Windows Focus Assist or macOS Do Not Disturb.
5. **Direct API Test:** Use the "Test Local Notification (Direct)" tool in Developer settings. If this fails, the browser/OS is blocking notifications globally.
6. **VAPID Integrity:** If VAPID keys change, "Clear Server Sub" + "Reset Service Worker" is mandatory.


## Task History
> Detailed task history is archived and maintained in `TaskHistory.md` (retaining at most the 3 most recent entries).

- **v9.1.23 (2026-09-04):** Distraction Badge High-Contrast Readability & Theme Optimization
  - *Distraction Count Legibility:* Replaced low-opacity tinted badges (`bg-indigo-500/30 text-indigo-300` etc.) with solid, high-contrast badges (`bg-indigo-600 text-white`, `bg-orange-600 text-white`, `bg-red-600 text-white`) with font-black weight and crisp top-left rounding.
  - *Universal Theme Support:* Ensured crystal-clear legibility across all 6 light and dark themes (Daylight, Warm Sun, Candy, Night, Forest, Ocean) in both Picture-in-Picture mode and the main dashboard timer.

- **v9.1.22 (2026-09-04):** Picture-in-Picture Condensed Mode Bottom Margin Compression
  - *Bottom Margin Reduction:* Reduced the bottom padding and margin of the PiP condensed mode (`padding-bottom: 0.25rem` / 4px and `margin-bottom: 0`), eliminating excessive blank bottom spacing below the distraction buttons.
  - *Vertical Balance:* Balanced top/bottom spacing across all PiP window height modes with `justify-between` and compact spacing.

- **v9.1.21 (2026-09-04):** Picture-in-Picture Distraction Button Sizing & Touch Comfort
  - *Distraction Tile Expansion:* Enlarged the 3 distraction buttons in PiP minimal/strip mode (`w-8.5 h-8.5` / `2.125rem` square tiles with `rounded-xl`), matching the classic layout proportion for effortless clicking and tapping.
  - *Icon Clarity & Badge Scaling:* Increased distraction icons to 17px (`Brain`, `Wind`, `Zap`) and scaled count indicators proportionately for crystal-clear legibility at compact window scales.
